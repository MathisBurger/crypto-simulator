# Information

---
The crypto simulator is an open source simulation game based on an angular web application.
You can trade with virtual currencies, but with real coin prices. Try it out yourself by 
creating an account on <a href="https://crypto-simulator.mathis-burger.de">
the main instance</a>.


# Idea

---
I had the idea to create the crypto simulator, because I am a highschool student. 
Therefore I am not allowed to trade with crypto currencies. But I was really interested
into this topic and wanted to learn more about crypto. 
I created this game, to learn more about crypto currencies and learn how to trade them.
